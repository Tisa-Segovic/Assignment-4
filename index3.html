				<p>For a long time, the presentation of the new collections of the Parisian fashion house Chanel is
				 linked to grand-creative production solutions that sometimes seem <i>unimaginable</i>, let alone 
				 <i>feasible</i>. However, this does not prevent Karl Lagerfeld to make his showcases with the scenery
				 that borders with madness. So far, Karl has been treating the audience with various megalomaniac 
				 "runways" and it is no surprise that he is expected to at least reach the level of production 
				 presented in the past.</p>

				<p id='hideTxt'>With his fashion vision for the next summer, Karl defined the fashion exactly as it should be, 
				as a fantasy, dreaming, without pretending to be profound. And as the line was, light and simple,
				soft and summery. In a handful of pastel colors, with many charming patterns, unbalanced and bare. 
				Karl took us for a moment to the sandy beach and again he spotted the summer, just what we want it to
				be. Even though we still need to wait for the whole year, until the next summer to get it.<br><br>
