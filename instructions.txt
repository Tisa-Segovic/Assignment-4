Create an HTML, CSS and a Javascript program(s):

You can create several HTML pages or one page, but make sure you provide all of the requiremnts needed for the following:

Create an application that allows the user to change image properties when you click on the image (Change at least 4 properties).
 

2) Create an application that displays a random image every time you load the page.

3) Create an application that displays a slideshow with a start and stops buttons.

4) Create a converter application that allows you to convert an amount from a USD to Euro. Use a form input field, onchange event, and a .js  to convert and display the result inside an element with id=result.

5) Create an application allowing you to display and validate input from user similar to Icecream shop we did in class. Use all types of fields such as 4 input fields for name, phone, email, zip code, selection, checkbox, radio and submit and reset fields.

You should make sure to validate all of the form elements:  Make sure tp for the following:

Check if the fields are empty or null;
Validate the zip code (5 digits of length and must be a number); and
Make sure that the email includes an at-sign (“@“) and a dot (“.“);
If the validation fails, alert the user and ask it to enter valid information, also use focus()select().

Extra credit will be awarded for excellent and creative work! Consider validating the email using regular expressions and adding additional design and technical features.

Tip: Review the JavaScript form validation using onsubmit()and classonchange() examples on the course website.
